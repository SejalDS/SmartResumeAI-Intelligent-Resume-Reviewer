# SmartResumeAI: Intelligent Resume Reviewer using LLMs and Azure

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

**SmartResumeAI** is an AI-powered resume analyzer that helps job seekers understand how well their resumes align with specific job descriptions. By leveraging advanced **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **embeddings**, and **cosine similarity**, the system provides **personalized recommendations**, highlights **missing skills**, and improves resume formatting to increase the chances of landing interviews.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

- Assess resume-job description similarity using semantic understanding
- Identify skill and formatting gaps in resumes
- Provide actionable improvement suggestions using GPT-4
- Enable users to upload resumes/JDs and receive insights in real time
- Deploy the system on **Azure** for accessibility and scalability
